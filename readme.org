* Overview

  This lib parses a file containing a loosely separated list of pairs.
  The pairs are those of mime-types to file extensions.

** Usage

*** Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC go
go get github.com/lcaballero/mime
#+END_SRC

*** Example Usage

After making a copy of mime-types.txt for your project and placing it
in a directory named `.file` the following code would parse the file
and make a map of extensions to mime-type.

#+BEGIN_SRC go
bin, _ := ioutil.ReadFile(".file/mime-types.txt")
r := bytes.NewReader(bin)

lookup, _ := mime.ParseExtensionsLookup(r)
mimeType, ok := lookup["jpeg"]

// mimeType == 'image/jpeg' typically at this point
#+END_SRC
